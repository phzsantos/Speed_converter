# Welcome!

### This is my first project using Git and GitHub

I'm starting in code. So my first program is not complex. It's just a speed converter.

### Project Status: Development


### Why Python?

I build in Python because this is my main language when we talk about code. Python was the first program language that I used. 


### Why a Speed Converter?

When I was at High School, I used to love Math. So, when I thouth about start coding, the only thing that pass throut my head was Math. Simple math, nothing like radials and this kind of things, just simple math. I know a lot of people has a problem when they go to convert Speed variables, this is the reson for my code exists. 


### About the future of the project

This project will be part of big something in the future. My plan is build a calculator of Physics and Mathematics. Of course, this is the future, but for now, i'm using this to learn python and programing logic.


### Will be a graphic interface someday?

Of Course! i'm start to think about it. In the first try I'll try pyQT and pyGTK, by the way, i'm a linux user.
